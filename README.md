The folder contains 4 files, for user-item prediction, refer to the files movielensrsme.ipynb and Movielens link pred.ipynb
For session-based recommender, refer to the file Sessionbaased Yoochoose.ipynb
For social recommender, refer to the file socialdata.ipynb.

To replicate the results, follow the steps in the notebook. For the session-based recommender task, obtaining the preprocessed data is necessary to run. To do that, download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chadgostopp/recsys-challenge-2015 and run Preprocess.ipynb on the relavent folders (changing the directory listed in the notebook) to get the processed files used in Session-based Yoochoose.ipynb.
